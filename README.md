# Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect phishing websites using machine learning models and various interpretability techniques to explain predictions.

## Features
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze patterns in phishing data.
* **Feature Embedding:** Generate embeddings for better feature representation.
* **Neural Network Models:** Build and train deep learning models for phishing detection.
* **Explainability:** Use SHAP, LIME, and Captum for model explainability.
