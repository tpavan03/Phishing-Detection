# Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect phishing websites using machine learning models and various interpretability techniques to explain predictions.

## Approach
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  * Checking for null values
  * Checking for duplicate values
  * Checking for missing values
  * Compared feature distribution with the labels
  * Compared the features with one another with different graphs
  * Generated conclusions based on the plots generated and explained our dataset and the relationships within attributes with respect to target class labels

* **Feature Embedding:** Generate embeddings for better feature representation.
* **Neural Network Models:** Build and train deep learning models for phishing detection.
* **Explainability:** Use SHAP, LIME, and Captum for model explainability.
